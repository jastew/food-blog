Porridge oats make a beautiful stuffing and reduce the total ingredients + the health benefits.

After accidentally buying the incorrect oats I had to find a way to use it all up.

I wanted to make my own stuffing but I didn't like the idea of using breadcrumbs as I don't know what went in to the original bread plus there are plenty of preservatives to keep the breadcrumbs fresh.
