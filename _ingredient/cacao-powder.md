This magical chocolate powder will add a touch of naughtiness without the guilt. Â I tend to match it with some sort of sweetener such as [maple](/recipes/ingredients/maple-syrup/) or [agave](/recipes/ingredients/agave-syrup/) syrup as I find it to be too bitter without it.

I add it to my [overnight oats](/breakfast/overnight-chocolate-maple-oats.html) every morning and use it when making bars.
